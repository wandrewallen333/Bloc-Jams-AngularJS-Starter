  * The home page features a logo I designed using Photoshop.  

  * The Collection page, accessed via the link in the upper right corner of the home page, presents a set of albums. Each album reference includes artist, album title, song count, and album art. Selecting an album loads the album page.

  * The Album page includes album data from the Collection page, plus a track list with track number, title, and duration. A player control with play/pause, track back, track forward, and sliders for controlling the position of the currently playing track and the volume level appears at the bottom in a semi-transparent overlay. Hovering over a track number causes a play icon to appear in the track number's place and a pause button appears in the same position for the currently playing track. The Buzz audio library is used to load, play, and present representations of meta data for audio files.
